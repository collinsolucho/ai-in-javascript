 Installation & Setup Instructions
mkdir (folderName)

npm install @tensorflow/tfjs (this runs on the client side ) 
npm install @tensorflow-models/mobilenet
npm run dev

tf.tensor a key word that changes input to tensor data

day one looked at meaning of tensor,model,prediction vs training
understood the diffrence between 
1. npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node(this runs on the server with nodejs) 
2. npm install @tensorflow/tfjs (this runs on the client side )
tf.tensor is running inside use effect since its retruns a side effect after ui renders
tensor.shapes  eg [2, 3] → 2 rows, 3 columns
        Tells you the dimensions of the tensor.
        Returns an array showing length along each axis.
tensor.size eg // 2 * 3 = 6
        Tells you the total number of elements in the tensor.
        Returns a single number (product of all dimensions)
2D Tensor (Matrix)
        Think of it as a table: rows × columns
        Shape: [rows, columns]
3D Tensor eg ✅ 2 “blocks”, each 2 rows × 2 columns
        Adds another dimension, like a stack of 2D matrices
        Shape: [depth, rows, columns] (or [height, width, channels] for images)
using a pretrained model (MobileNet) to run simple predictions
>>>>> instalation .... npm install @tensorflow-models/mobilenet
use await tf.ready() this guarantees TensorFlow.js is fully loaded.
await tf.setBackend("webgl") TensorFlow.js which engine to use for computation.
Backend	Speed	Use Case
webgl	🚀 Fast (GPU)	Best for ML tasks, image models
cpu	🐢 Slow	Fallback; debugging
wasm	⚡ Fast CPU	Some tasks faster than plain CPU

A univariate regression model predicts an output using one input variable only.
A dense layer is a grid of neurons where each node listens to all inputs (eg a discussion where an answer is raised after everyone listens to comments from previous group)


const model = tf.sequential();

model.add(tf.layers.dense({
  units: 1,       // one output neuron
  inputShape: [1] // one input number
}));

model.compile({
  loss: "meanSquaredError",
  optimizer: "sgd",
});
