tf.tensor a key word that changes input to tensor data

day one looked at meaning of tensor,model,prediction vs training
understood the diffrence between 
1. npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node(this runs on the server with nodejs) 
2. npm install @tensorflow/tfjs (this runs on the client side )
tf.tensor is running inside use effect since its retruns a side effect after ui renders
tensor.shapes  eg [2, 3] → 2 rows, 3 columns
        Tells you the dimensions of the tensor.
        Returns an array showing length along each axis.
tensor.size eg // 2 * 3 = 6
        Tells you the total number of elements in the tensor.
        Returns a single number (product of all dimensions)
2D Tensor (Matrix)
        Think of it as a table: rows × columns
        Shape: [rows, columns]
3D Tensor eg ✅ 2 “blocks”, each 2 rows × 2 columns
        Adds another dimension, like a stack of 2D matrices
        Shape: [depth, rows, columns] (or [height, width, channels] for images)
MAKING PREDICTONS(Regression)
using a pretrained model (MobileNet) to run simple predictions
>>>>> instalation .... npm install @tensorflow-models/mobilenet
use await tf.ready() this guarantees TensorFlow.js is fully loaded.
await tf.setBackend("webgl") TensorFlow.js which engine to use for computation.
Backend	        Speed	                 Use Case
webgl	        🚀 Fast (GPU)	         Best for ML tasks, image models
cpu	        🐢 Slow	Fallback;        debugging
wasm	        ⚡ Fast CPU	        Some tasks faster than plain CPU

A univariate regression model predicts an output using one input variable only.
A dense layer is a grid of neurons where each node listens to all inputs (eg a discussion where an answer is raised after everyone listens to comments from previous group)
A neuron is a tiny computational unit that takes input, performs a calculation, and produces an output.
A neuron = takes inputs → multiplies by weights → adds bias → applies activation function → gives output.
Units = number of neurons in the layer. //more units more power
weights = whats learned/answers

MODEL ARCHITURE 
                model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, inputShape: [1] }));

LOSS FUNCTION 
                          model.compile({
                        loss: "meanSquaredError",// predicts numbers
                        optimizer: "sgd", //tells model how to update
                        });
Activation functions decide what output each neuron should produce.
🔥 Common Activation Functions
Activation	Meaning	                                  Common Use
ReLU	     Turns negatives into 0, keeps positives	Hidden layers (default)
Sigmoid	     Output between 0 and 1	               Binary classification
Softmax	     Turns outputs into probabilities	       Multi-class classification
Linear	     No activation	                       Regression (predicting numbers)
Backpropagation is making guess while comparing correct output while adjusting weights to reduce error
epochs repeating cycles to get better
optimizer an algorithm that tells the model how to update its weights to learn better.
Common Optimizers
adam → most popular, fast, stable
sgd → simple but slow
rmsprop → handles noisy data well
loss Function measures how wrong the model’s prediction is.
🧠 Common Loss Functions
Loss	                        Used For
meanSquaredError	        Regression (predicting numbers)
categoricalCrossentropy	        Multi-class classification
binaryCrossentropy	        Yes/No classification
Batch size = how many samples the model processes at one time before updating weights.
inputShape → Defines the shape of the input data the first layer expects.Only needed in the first layer.
tf.layers.dense() is used to create a Dense (Fully Connected) layer
tf.sequential() keyword used to create a simple, linear neural network model.
Compile → Sets the optimizer and loss function to train the model.
🔍 Explanation:
Keyword	                          Meaning
xs	                Input data (features)
ys	                Target data (labels)
epochs: 50	        Train over the entire dataset 50 times
callbacks.onEpochEnd	Function executed after each epoch; here we log the loss
logs.loss	        Shows the current error the model has
.predict() is the inference function that asks the model to predict with given data
.fit() is the training function for your neural network. tells the model>>
“Here’s the input data and the correct output. Learn the patterns to make predictions.”
DESSION MAKING (classification)>> return true/false,,yes/no,,0/1
Eg is 2 an even number ()

model architecture
                        model.add(tf.layers.dense({
                        units: 1,
                        inputShape: [1],
                         activation: "sigmoid", // output value 0&1
                        }));

loss function 
                        model.compile({
                        loss: "binaryCrossentropy",
                        optimizer: "adam",
                        });

training example
        const xs = tf.tensor([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]);
        const ys = tf.tensor([0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]); // even = 1
